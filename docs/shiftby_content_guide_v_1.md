## 1. Universal Context (Always Include in Prompts)

When generating ANY content for Shiftby, you must ground the model with this context (paraphrased or pasted as-is into the system/instruction part of the prompt):

> **About Shiftby**  
> Shiftby helps professionals and small teams feel more confident, capable, and hopeful in an AI-driven world. It does this through practical role-based training, small applied Missions, and gentle AI support that fits real work.  
> Shiftby is people-first, not AI-first. AI is a tool and amplifier; training, coaching, and reflection are the true enablers of transformation.
>
> **Tone & Values**  
> - Empathetic, calm, respectful.  
> - Practical and clear, no jargon where avoidable.  
> - Honest about what AI can and cannot do.  
> - No fear-based messaging (no “you’ll be obsolete if…”).  
> - Celebrate existing experience and strengths; frame growth as realistic next steps.
>
> **Audience**  
> - Working professionals in roles like HR, People Partners, managers, business analysts, product managers, operations/finance, and tech enablers.  
> - Many are busy, somewhat anxious about AI and job security, but motivated to learn.  
> - Some content will also address small teams and leaders considering how to support their people.
>
> **Brand Promise**  
> Shiftby offers grounded, role-specific, applied learning with AI. The focus is on better work today and stronger careers tomorrow, not on hype or pure technology.

Every prompt must **align with this context**.

## 2. Tone, Voice & Style Rules

**Positioning Rule (Non-Negotiable)**  
Avoid positioning Shiftby as a generic IT or technical training site. Always frame Shiftby as a **business- and role-focused capability building partner** that uses AI as a tool to improve real work and careers.



### 2.1 Tone

- **Empathetic & human:** Acknowledge stress, uncertainty, and real-life constraints.  
- **Encouraging but realistic:** Offer hope and options without overpromising.  
- **Calm, not hyped:** Avoid sensational language.

**Allowed examples:**
- "If work has felt heavier lately, you’re not alone."  
- "Here’s one small way you can use AI this week to make things easier."  
- "You already bring a lot of experience – Shiftby helps you build on it."

**Avoid:**
- "If you don’t learn AI now, you’ll be left behind."  
- "Revolutionize everything instantly with AI!"  
- Aggressive sales language.


### 2.2 Voice

- **Personality:** Warm, thoughtful, practical, like a trusted mentor.  
- **Pronouns:** Use "you" for the reader; "we" for Shiftby as a supportive partner.  
- **Perspective:** Business-first, people-first; tech is secondary.


### 2.3 Language & Readability

- Short paragraphs, simple sentences.  
- Avoid heavy jargon; when needed, explain terms briefly.  
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract claims.


### 2.4 No-Fear & No-Shame Rule

- Never shame the reader for what they don’t know.  
- Never use fear of job loss as a primary motivator.  
- Focus on agency, learning, and small wins.

---

## 3. Content Pillars & Themes

All Shiftby content should primarily sit within these pillars:

1. **Better Work Today**  
   - Practical ways to use AI in daily tasks (emails, reports, analyses, planning, reviews, communication).

2. **Stronger Career Tomorrow**  
   - How to build AI-enabled capabilities, tell your story, and navigate career transitions with confidence.

3. **Gentle Organizational Change**  
   - How leaders, HR, and teams can adopt AI responsibly, with respect for people and culture.

4. **Human-Centred AI Literacy**  
   - Explaining AI concepts in business language, with clear limitations and risks.

Every content piece must clearly align with at least **one** of these pillars (ideally two).

---

## 4. Web & UX Content Rules (Mobile-First, Blazing Fast)

These rules apply to website pages, landing pages, and any UI copy.

### 4.1 Mobile-First Content Layout

- **Write for small screens first.**  
  - Short headings (max ~6–8 words where possible).  
  - Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences).  
  - Use bullet lists for scannability.

- Place the **main benefit or message in the first two screenfuls** on mobile.

- Avoid walls of text; break into sections with clear subheadings.


### 4.2 Clear CTAs With Minimal Clicks

- Every key page should answer quickly:
  - "What is this?"  
  - "Is this for me?"  
  - "What can I do next?"

- CTAs should be **simple and low-friction**, e.g.:
  - "Join the next live session"
  - "Get the course details"
  - "Download the guide"

- Avoid sending users through more than **2–3 clicks** to reach:
  - Program details
  - Registration or contact


### 4.3 Performance-Friendly Content Practices

- Keep copy **concise**; avoid unnecessary filler. Less content = faster pages.  
- Prefer text + a few meaningful visuals over heavy, decorative assets.  
- Avoid embedding lengthy, unstructured content directly on home/landing pages – link to blogs/resources.

---

## 5. SEO Rules (Must-Follow)

All web pages and blogs must be **SEO-aware**, but **human-first**.

### 5.1 On-Page SEO Basics

For each page or blog post:

- Define a **primary keyword** (aligned with real user intent, e.g. "AI for HR business partners").
- Use it (or close variants):
  - In the **page title** (H1).  
  - In the first 1–2 paragraphs.  
  - 2–4 more times naturally in the body.

- Include a **meta description** (120–160 characters):
  - Clear benefit + audience + gentle CTA.

- Use **one H1** and structured H2/H3s.  
- Include internal links to:
  - related articles,
  - program pages,
  - relevant resources.


### 5.2 Keyword Use & Natural Language

- Never stuff keywords. If a sentence sounds unnatural, rewrite it.  
- Prioritise clarity and empathy over keyword density.  
- Use semantically related phrases instead of repeating the same keyword.


### 5.3 Content Depth & Value

- Prefer **fewer, higher-quality articles** over many shallow posts.  
- Each blog should:
  - address a clear question or scenario,  
  - offer practical steps or examples,  
  - connect to relevant Shiftby offers or Missions.


### 5.4 Reuse Inspiral SEO Engine (Process Rule)

When planning topics and outlines:

- Use the existing **Inspiral keyword research + clustering process** to identify:  
  - role-specific themes (e.g. HR, managers, BA, product),  
  - pain points (burnout, layoffs, pressure, AI confusion),  
  - career and capability queries.

- Apply those insights to Shiftby content **without copying tone** from generic SEO blogs; always reframe through the Shiftby lens.

## 6. Social Media Content Rules

Shiftby’s social presence (especially LinkedIn) should be:

- Human, story-driven, and value-focused.  
- Consistent with the same empathy and realism as long-form content.

### 6.1 Post Types

Common patterns:

1. **Micro-stories**  
   - A short story of a real situation (anonymised) where AI changed how work was done.

2. **Mini how-tos**  
   - 3–5 bullet tips on using AI in a specific scenario.

3. **Reflections on change**  
   - Thoughts on layoffs, pressure, and capability-building, with a hopeful framing.

4. **Program highlights**  
   - Gentle promotion of workshops/Journeys with a focus on outcomes, not hype.


### 6.2 Style for Social Posts

- Hook in the first 1–2 lines, but avoid clickbait.  
- Use short paragraphs and line breaks for readability.  
- Add 3–6 thoughtful hashtags (role-based, AI+work, careers, capability).  
- Always include either:
  - a clear takeaway, or  
  - a simple next step (comment, save, link).


### 6.3 Cross-Channel Consistency

- Social posts should **echo** core website and blog messages, not contradict them.  
- Avoid promising things that main offers don’t deliver.

**Rules:**

- Each page must have:
  - Clear primary audience

---

## 8. Non-Negotiable Red Lines

Shiftby content **must not**:

- Use fear or shame as primary motivation.  
- Overpromise results ("transform overnight", "guaranteed promotions").

If a draft accidentally does this, it must be rewritten.
